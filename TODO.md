# Audio Server Project - TODOs

## Hardware Setup
- [ ] Acquire Raspberry Pi (recommend RPi 4 with at least 2GB RAM)
- [ ] Set up Raspberry Pi with latest Raspberry Pi OS (64-bit recommended)
- [ ] Configure network settings for wired/wireless connection
- [ ] Configure audio output device (USB DAC or HAT recommended for better quality)

## Software Installation

### Core Components
- [ ] Install required system dependencies
- [ ] Install and configure Shairport Sync (AirPlay receiver)
- [ ] Install and configure Snapcast Server (audio distribution)
- [ ] Install and configure Snapcast Client (audio playback) 
- [ ] Set up Snapweb interface (web control panel)

### System Configuration
- [ ] Configure system for auto-startup of services
- [ ] Setup proper audio pipeline between Shairport Sync and Snapcast
- [ ] Configure audio settings for optimal quality
- [ ] Enable system monitoring and logging
- [ ] Configure firewall settings to allow necessary services

## Testing & Validation
- [ ] Test AirPlay connection from various devices (iOS, macOS, etc.)
- [ ] Validate audio quality and latency
- [ ] Test multiple concurrent connections
- [ ] Stress test system performance under load
- [ ] Verify web interface functionality

## Optimization
- [ ] Optimize CPU/memory usage
- [ ] Reduce audio latency if needed
- [ ] Improve boot time and service startup
- [ ] Implement power saving configurations

## Documentation
- [ ] Document full installation process
- [ ] Create user manual for connecting to the server
- [ ] Document troubleshooting steps for common issues
- [ ] Create network diagram and component overview

## Future Enhancements
- [ ] Multi-room audio synchronization
- [ ] Additional input sources (Spotify Connect, Bluetooth, etc.)
- [ ] Integration with home automation systems
- [ ] Mobile app control
- [ ] Volume normalization across sources
